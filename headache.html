    <h1>Headache</h1>
    <p>
      A headache is pain or discomfort in the head or face area. Types of
      headaches include migraine, tension, and cluster. Headaches can be primary
      or secondary. If it is secondary, it is caused by another condition.
      Avoiding headache triggers is the best prevention.
